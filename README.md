Hey there! I am a rising senior at Duke studying math and computer science. I am open to full-time data science roles for after my graduation. I am especially      passionate about the math behind machine learning algorithms and ethical AI. Aside from crunching numbers and programming, I am a huge basketball fan and love learning languages.

### Project 1: [2021 IEEE GRSS Data Science Competition](https://www.grss-ieee.org/community/technical-committees/2021-ieee-grss-data-fusion-contest-track-dse/)

**The Task:** Develop models that take advantage of various channels of satellite data to spot remote areas around the globe where humans live without electricity

**My Work:** I built and trained various FCN (Fully Convolutional Network) architectures using Pytorch on a Duke compute cluster to classify 50m x 50m tiles as containing a human settlement without electricity or not. I also acted as the project leader for our team of four Duke undergraduates

**The result:** Together, we placed top 25 in the international challenge, in which we competed against research labs and PhD student teams from around the globe

**What I Learned:** Pytorch, the mathematics underpinning CNN's and Neural Networks, bash scripting

**Favorite Memory:** A flurry of zoom calls on the night of our submissions -- we were simultaneously nervous for the results, proud of what we had accomplished, and connected as a team
